## SVR and Linear Regression Salary Prediction

This repository presents an analysis of salary prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Linear Regression models. The analysis leverages `Salary_Data.csv`, focusing on predicting salaries based on years of experience.

### Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Standardization of features with `StandardScaler`.
- **Modeling**:
  - **Linear Regression**: Train and evaluate with performance metrics.
  - **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Implement with a linear kernel; assess using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.
- **Visualization**:
  - Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted salaries for both training and test sets.
  - Comparison plots of model performance.

### Results:
- Detailed performance comparison of SVR and Linear Regression models.
- Visual insights into the prediction accuracy and model fit.
